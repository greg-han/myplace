# myPlace
## A place where you can find your place.
Welcome to myPlace! This is a place where you can find your place! 
It's called myplace and not your place because when you are in myPlace this place is your place! 
So when you are here, you will feel like this is "my" place (My as in you when you are considering this to be your own).
You can customize your experience here and find what ti is that interests and drives you.

# This is my personal project. It will be updated soon.
I have ideas about how the profile system is going to work out but I don't want to add them yet.
I still need to get the damn redux state to transfer through all of the components.

The basic idea of this app will be a personal profile that is composed of your queries.
Machine learning will the be used on the queries to find similar queries to your aggregate queries.
I'm not trying to build a search engine, this is different.

The other part that i'm going to add is what will make this really unique and has almost nothign to do with questions, but will 
have something to do with aggregating your profile data. I purposefully did not add it in here yet, because I want to design it fully
before I add the components of it. It's nothing mindblowing or anything, it's just not really out in the mainstream right now.
Probably because it doesn't have much of a commercial purpose. I can't see how it would work with a commerical purpose because that would mean that some sites get
priority over others, and that would mean that you wouldn't get the full experience that you should. Maybe if it ever has more than one user (me) then it can generate something
just from the fact that it will point something somewhere but I doubt it and I don't really care because that's not the point.

I still suck pretty bad so this will probably take a while (but i get just a little (sometimes a lot) better everyday), although it seems like I learn something new literally everyday when i'm working on this.

Teh cool part of this, is that as i'm going to design it so that it will be just as useful with one person as it will be with many people.

Thanks for stopping by!
-Greg.
